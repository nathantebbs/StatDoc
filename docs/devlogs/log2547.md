# Formalizing Ideas and Adding Some Extras

## Boring Stuff

Today a good amount of effort went towards some boring things. First off, I decided to
make a basic Dockerfile so people that are interested in building the language can use
Docker to try it out. I know a lot of people that use pretty much every operating system
that you can think of, which means that all my friends who know how to code are on
completely different development environments. This is what inspired me to add a
Dockerfile to this project. However, there is possibly an even better solution that only
requires a C compiler to work, be sure to checkout [noh.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h). 
For now I am going to stick with Docker just because it is default cirriculum at my
university and most know how to use it. Also, just had the idea to make these logs more
bloggish, so maybe once school winds down I will make a website for the language!
