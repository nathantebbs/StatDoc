# Initial Lexer Finished

Today I completed the beginnings of the lexer implementation. Currently, it just reads in lines and goes through each token present, skipping any whitespace
and also collects blocks of strings that are present. Overall, I am enjoying returning to C after programming in python for a while for school. So far the development
process has been relaxed and I am able to find a lot of resources online to help me out.

The next step in the process is going to be the parser. As for the language itself and how it functions, I plan on making some mockups just for inspiration which I
will probably push later today.
