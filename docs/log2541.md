# Starting a new programming language

Today I have decided to try and start writing my own programming language. The motivation for making something
like this has come from one of the classes I am taking this semester, CSc 380 Principles of Data Science.
My vision for this language comes from the quality of life feature from google colab, like writing rich text
alongside code (specifically markdown and latex). There should be builtin support for features seen in python,
matplotlib, and pandas alongside a simple syntax structure similar to python and javascript.

I am currently undecided on if I want to have the language be compiled or not. From the resources I am using
online, it appears that deciding that is only necessary after the lexer, parser, and AST stuff is completed.

Overall, I'm looking forward to hopefully finishing this eventually and learning a lot more about C. Also, forgot
to mention that I chose C as the language to write it in because I like it.
